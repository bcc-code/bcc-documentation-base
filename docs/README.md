# Introduction

Here you will find guides and tips on how to set up and maintain documentation for BCC projects. We value good documentation for both our open source and internal projects. Because we recognize it is hard to keep documentation up-to-date, we try to make it as easy as possible to maintain and publish documentation to our website, [developer.bcc.no](https://developer.bcc.no).
