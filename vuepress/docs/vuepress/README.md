# Custom theme

The documentation sites (like this one) use a custom [VuePress 2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/) theme, based on the default theme. This means that any [Markdown plugins](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html) used by VuePress can also be used in your documentation.

This theme will build a sidebar from the folder structure in your `docs` folder, with titles derived from the primary heading in each Markdown file.
